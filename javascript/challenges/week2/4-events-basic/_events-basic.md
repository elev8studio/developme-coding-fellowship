# Event Driven Programming

## Challenges

**Compare your result with the demo**.

### 01

Using `clicked.html`. With JavaScript *every time* you click the button, create a new `<p>` underneath with the word "Clicked!" in it.

[Demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/develop-me/book-marks/blob/develop/week-04--dom/challenges/03/answers/clicked/clicked.html)

### 02

Using `counter.html`. Each time the button is clicked the text of the `<p>` tag should change to show how many times the button has been clicked.

[Demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/develop-me/book-marks/blob/develop/week-04--dom/challenges/03/answers/counter/counter.html)

### 03

Using `todo.html`. When you click the button, the text inside the input should appear as the **first** item in a list. It should have a class of `list-group-item`.

[Demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/develop-me/book-marks/blob/develop/week-04--dom/challenges/03/answers/todo/todo.html)

### 04

Using your `border.js` file from yesterday, update the JavaScript so that when the user clicks on the `<div>`, its border colour should alternate between red and black.

[Demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/develop-me/book-marks/blob/develop/week-04--dom/challenges/03/answers/border/border.html)

### 05

Using your `image.js` file from yesterday, update the JavaScript so that every time you click the image it should double in size. Try adding a button to reset the size (feel free to edit the HTML to add the Reset button).

[Demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/develop-me/book-marks/blob/develop/week-04--dom/challenges/03/answers/image/image.html)

### 06

Update your `size.js` file from yesterday so that it updates the window dimensions on resizing the window.

[Demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/develop-me/book-marks/blob/develop/week-04--dom/challenges/03/answers/size/size.html)

### 07

Add JavaScript to `colour-picker.html` so that it works.

[Demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/develop-me/book-marks/blob/develop/week-04--dom/challenges/03/answers/colour-picker/colour-picker.html)

### 08

Using `store.html`. When the "Store" button is pressed, the input field should be cleared and its value stored. When the "Display" button is pressed all previously submitted values should appear as a list underneath (each `<li>` should have a class of `list-group-item`). Nothing should be displayed until the "Display" button is pressed. This should work for any number of text submissions.

## Tricksy Challenges

### 09

Add JavaScript to `transition.html` so that the entire background colour changes in response to the current scroll position. You'll want to use `hsl` (not `rgb`). Keep the saturation and lightness values at `50%`, but transition the hue value from `0` (red - at the top) to `360` (red again - at the bottom). It should be cyan about half way down the page. **Don't** hardcode the height of the page - it should work for any page height.

[Demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/develop-me/book-marks/blob/develop/week-04--dom/challenges/03/answers/transition/transition.html)

### 10

Using `palindrome.html`. When the button is clicked, display in the answer `<p>` whether the text in the input is a palindrome.

[Demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/develop-me/book-marks/blob/develop/week-04--dom/challenges/03/answers/palindrome/palindrome.html)

### 11

Using `calculator.html`. When you click one of the buttons it should do the correct mathematical operation using the two values from the text inputs (e.g. if `+` is pressed, it should add the two values together). Output the answer in the `<p>` tag below.

[Demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/develop-me/book-marks/blob/develop/week-04--dom/challenges/03/answers/calculator/calculator.html)

### 12

Using `items.html`. Using *just* JavaScript, make it so that if the `<main>` width is less than 400px wide the grid is one item wide, less than 600px two items wide, less than 800px three items wide, etc. It should update when the window is resized and work for any width screen.
