For each challenge create a new `.js` file. Then run `node filename.js` to see if it's worked.

1) Write some code that lists the numbers from 1 to 100 using a `for` loop

2) Write some code that lists the numbers from 100 to 1 using a `for` loop

3) Write some code that lists all multiples of 13 up to 1,000 using a `for` loop

4) Write some code that lists all multiples of 13 up to 1,000 using a `while` loop
