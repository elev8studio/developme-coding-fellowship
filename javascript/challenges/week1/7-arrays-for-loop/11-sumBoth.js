// Create a function, sumBoth, that takes two arrays of numbers as arguments. Return the sum of all the numbers from both arrays.

// Hint: to avoid repeating code, you might want to write a sum function that adds up the values in a single array and call that inside sumBoth

// ... your function here

console.log(
    sumBoth([2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4]), // 30
    sumBoth([2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [5, 10, 12]), // 47
);
