# Prototyping

### Wireframing is good for:

- Send to client
- Comments & Discussions
- Adjustments
- Problems
- Versions
- Visualise & planning

### Wireframing doesn't give you:

- Interactivity

> Without the usability of something it can be hard to visualise

### Solution? Prototypes!

> A _quick_ interactive workable solution

### Exercise:

Let's create a working prototype of a page

To do this we're going to use a CSS Framework

## Frameworks, libraries, APIs

### Library

A library is a collection of functions / objects that serves one particular purpose. You could use a library in a variety of projects.

Examples:
- jquery
- React
- moment.js

### Framework

A framework is a collection of patterns and libraries to help with building an application.

Examples:
- Bootstrap
- Angular
- Rails (by Ruby)

### API

An API is an interface for other programs to interact with your program without having direct access.

Examples:
- Google Maps
- Weather
- Social networks e.g. My Latest Tweets is interacting with Twitter API

To put it another way, think of a library as an add-on / piece of an application, a framework as the skeleton of the application, and an API as an outward-facing part of said app.

### Tooling / Preprocessor

Tools that enable us to construct data. For example, SASS and SCSS are preprocessors because they help us to construct CSS.

A framework is a collection of patterns and libraries.

You can re-use the code you're writing. HTML is repetitive, for example, headers, navigation etc.

## Examples of CSS Frameworks

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/)
- [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/)
- [Semantic](https://semantic-ui.com/)
- [Pure](https://purecss.io/)
- [Milligram](https://milligram.io/)

A framework is a collection of patterns, and reusable code.

## Where to use frameworks

Not every framework is good for every project

- Prototyping
- Docs
- Quick win

## Why use a framework

- So you don't have to do the work

## How

- You include the code (probably a css file or files)
- You use the given HTML.

### Start by reading the docs

[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)

### Bootstrap under the hood

[https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v4-dev/scss](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v4-dev/scss)

### Reason why it's good

- Quicker (once you've learnt)
- Work done for you
- Kept up to date

### Reasons why it's bad

- Tied into a system, 'breaking out' is more work
- Bespoke styling is hard
- No control over support
- So. Much. Code!

### Exercise

- Build a page with Bootstrap
- Download it and include it
- Read the docs and start adding HTML to your page
