# HTML - Day 1

Computers take everything you write very literally. We can interpret slurred speech, but computers cannot. Do not add spaces to any files or folders.

## How the internet works

NOT a bubble cloud. The internet is a WIRE. A server is a folder connected to the internet, and a website is a file on that server.

## Languages

### Backend languages
- PHP
- Ruby
- Python
- Java
- C (C++, C#)
- JavaScript

### Front-end languages
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

CSS makes HTML look pretty. JavaScript makes HTML functionally interactive.

## HTML

HTML is data. Based on XML. Stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

## HTML structure
```
<element attr="param">
	insert content here
</element>
```

### Paragraph element
```
<p class="paragraph" id="specificParagraph">Paragraph content</p>
```

### Anchor element (or link)
```
<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>
```

### Self closing element tags
```
<input type="text" name="firstname" />

<img src="" />
```

## File Naming
Always start with index.html. The browser will always look for index.html. That's why it's called index.

When you have a really long !DOCTYPE, it just means the page is an older version of HTML.

Where possible, ALWAYS use semantic elements e.g. section, aside, article.

## Layout
`article` - Generally an article element is used for standalone content

`section` - Generally a section denotes a specific area of the page e.g. some text and images. Used for page layout or to separate areas of the page.

`aside` - Generally used for related content, or a sidebar.

## Special Elements
`button` - NOT to be used as links, just in page behaviour, e.g. close modal, play video

`details` - Details element must contain nested summary element. Creates a summary title with expandable details.

## Head Section
What's included in a HTML head tag?
